The photos are beautiful and will hopefully help us learn more about weather patterns and other phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpace agencies around the globe have been trying to study the weather for years, with NASA even using a CubeSat several years ago. With newer satellites like the MTG-I1, though, the goals that scientists have could finally be obtainable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeteosat first images of Earth\\r\\nImage source: EUMETSAT/ESA\\r\\nThese first images from MTG-I1 focused on the Atlantic, Europe, and Austraila, providing tons of remarkable detail in the clouds and other global conditions. The image itself was captured by MTG-I1’s Flexible Combined Imager back in March. The satellite originally launched in December of 2022, so it has taken a few months to get everything set up and operational.\\r\\n\\r\\nTech. Entertainment. Science.

The quality of the images captured by MTG-I1 is exceptional, too, and that quality even shows in time-lapses of weather conditions, which you can see in action below.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeteosat first images of Earth\\r\\nImage source: EUMETSAT/ESA\\r\\nThe level of detail found in these first images from MTG-I1 is a clear example of just how important European cooperation in space is, according to the ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli. Cheli says this kind of detail was unobtainable before MTG-I1, so the satellite is literally changing the perspective at which we can study European weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe images that MTG-I1 can capture are also capable of capturing great detail in cloud structures at high latitudes, which the ESA says will help make it easier for weather forecasts to monitor the evolution of severe weather in the region.', 'illustrationLink': 'https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AdobeStock_194080021.jpeg?resize=1020%2C574&quality=82', 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None}}, {'use_case': {'id': 5, 'name': 'Incognito', 'description': 'This project is secret', 'illustrationLink': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None}}, {'use_case': {'id': 51, 'name': 'Test', 'description': 'Show new test case', 'illustrationLink': 'https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/715425db-6c68-4fe6-9ed9-bc71814092e1/dexf5py-1a5bb40e-2e09-454a-80d2-a972a74d7741.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzcxNTQyNWRiLTZjNjgtNGZlNi05ZWQ5LWJjNzE4MTQwOTJlMVwvZGV4ZjVweS0xYTViYjQwZS0yZTA5LTQ1NGEtODBkMi1hOTcyYTc0ZDc3NDEuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.6zdH1k9rDGvqCsyfF1q0njMcd4k9ElUEZsN1jvZ5nuY', 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None}}]\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                               name  \\\n","0  Urban Green Space Revitalization   \n","1       Renewable Energy Initiative   \n","2   Historical Preservation Program   \n","3                      Mother Earth   \n","4                         Incognito   \n","5                              Test   \n","\n","                                         description                 duration  \\\n","0  This project focuses on transforming an underu...  2022-12-01 - 2013-11-30   \n","1  This project aims to increase the adoption of ...            2024-02-01 -    \n","2  This project is dedicated to preserving and re...
